# MOIA (Playground) - Our code on the road to future mobility.

At MOIA, we believe that ridepooling can make our cities better, safer and more beautiful places to live in. As a partner of the cities, we therefore work closely with public and private mobility partners to make urban mobility so demand-oriented, flexible and convenient that, together, the mobility revolution can succeed.
