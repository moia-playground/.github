**Organization-wide .github actions and other metadata.**

## What's happening here?

Organizations can add community health files to a specially named .github repository to serve as organization-wide defaults for all repositories within their organization.

>  You can add files to an organization-owned .github repository, and if a given files don’t exist for a repository, the organization-wide default will be used.

While the file itself won’t appear in the file browser or Git history for each repository, it will be surfaced throughout developers’ workflows, such as when opening a new issue or when viewing the Community Profile, just as if it were committed to the repository directly.
